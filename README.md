🎯 Why I Built This
This project was part of my academic minor project and a way to sharpen my front-end development skills. I wanted to create something meaningful, functional, and real-world inspired. The idea of building a gym website was exciting because it allowed me to work with:

Modular design

Real content structure (members & trainers)

UI/UX design decisions

Page linking and file separation

🔮 What's Next?
Here are some features I’d love to implement in the future:

User login/signup system

Class booking functionality for the schedule

Admin dashboard for managing trainers and members

E-commerce add-ons (cart, payment gateway)

Dynamic backend with Firebase or Node.js
